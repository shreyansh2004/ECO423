Problem Statement for the assignment


I have saved an interesting case study in the folder. You are supposed to go through the 
case study and the data (for analysis) and answer the following questions in about 300 
words each, excluding tables and figures analysed. Please provide the analysis results 
wherever applicable. The assignment folder contains the case study and data. The 
assignment should not be only qualitative. You will also submit the Excel workings or 
code if you are using any platforms. 


 1. Which stock do you believe provides the most attractive investment 
opportunity for the Cavalier Fund? Why? 
 2. How would you characterise the riskiness of the different stocks being 
considered by the Cavalier Fund? Which stock do you believe is the 
riskiest, and which is the least risky? 
 3. How does portfolio diversification affect your characterisation of risk for 
the stocks? 
 4. Kramer argues that the returns associated with a 50-50 weighted portfolio 
of Groupon and Kinross Gold have a lower standard deviation than those 
associated with either Groupon or Kinross Gold stock alone. Is that true? 
 5. What is the argument for Kinross Gold? 
 6. How should investors price risk? How should they trade off the relation 
between risk and return? 
 7. What is the risk-adjusted benchmark return on the S&P 500 portfolio? On 
the proposed stocks? 
 8. How should Nickerson think about picking stocks for the Cavalier Fund?
